 Web client robotplace:
 1) ping online status
 2) get table readkey and writekey
 3) read a table
 4) write to a table
 5) read/write device profile info incl. messages
 6) TCP liveData connect, login, read, write
 7) TCP liveData read, write data
 8) UDP liveData connect, login, read, write
 9) added Progmem to store strings (first step to reduce code size)
 
 ISSUES
 1) working, stability to verify
 2) working, stability testing --- working for 12h without an interruption
 3) working, stable, working for 27 hours - ok (strange one case of non detection on LAN disconnection)
 4) better TCP disconnection and UDP logout detection

 // function rmdevice.info( infoType, data ) is not returning a value until request finished or timeout
 // example on the new library use
